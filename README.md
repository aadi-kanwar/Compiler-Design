# Compiler-Design
A repository with a few concepts of Compiler Design.

> Please prefer using a linux based OS for execution of `lex` based programs.

## Table of Contents
1. [Generic Commands](#Generic-terminal-Commands)
2. [Token Separation](#Token-Separation)
3. [Token Count](#Token-Count)
4. [DFA](#Siulation-of-DFA)

## Generic terminal Commands
> These are commands generic to the codes in the repository. Any special commands would be added to their respective project headings.
- Command 1  `lex <filename.l>`  
- Command 2  `gcc lex.yy.c`
- Output command  `./a.out`

## Token Separation
- An experiment wherein code is written in Lex code to separate tokens from an input file or from the input given by the user in through the terminal.
- 2 files are to be made, one with `.l` extension and the other with `.c` which will serve as the input file.
- After the files are made the code is written. Save and close the files.
- Use the commands above to run the code.

## Token Count
- A program to calculate the number of tokens in a given input file or user input.
- 2 files; one `.l` file and one `.c` file.
- In the `Token Count` folder you shall be able to see two `.l` files.
- `token_num.l` contains the code to output the number of tokens.
- `token_num2.l` file outputs both the separated tokens and the total number as well.
- Use the commands above for running.
